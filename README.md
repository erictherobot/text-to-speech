Convert text to speech (audio and mp3, wav, etc) with Python.

If you want to convert text to speech (audio and mp3, wav, etc) with Python, you can use the [gTTS](https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API. Write spoken mp3 data to a file, a file-like object (bytestring) for further audio manipulation, or `stdout`. Or simply pre-generate Google Translate TTS request URLs to feed to an external program.
